Tried dwm fifo patch, compiles but doesn't run
Removed media tag and associated programs- it's just never intuitive
Manually changed all layout patches to #include a new c file instead of patching dwm.c.
	Updates to dwm should no longer break the patches
Added a dirty hack to quit dwm out of the loop in xinitrc

TODO 
patch that shows possible actions to help navigate the endless keyboard shortcuts
initial thought: MOD4 activates gui and shows base mod4+key. Other mod combinations are excluded unless pressed (mod4+ctrl+key to see those shortcuts, etc). Ideally it sources from the user's config.h such that it becomes a tool for exploring other dwm configurations

patch to search and execute dwm commands
there are plenty of interesting patches I may never use enough to remember the key combo. If it can be executed without arguments, a gui not unlike vscode/obsidian/windowsterminal could let users visualize what is there
